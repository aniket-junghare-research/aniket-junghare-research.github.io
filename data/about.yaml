  I am Aniket Junghare, a PhD Research Scholar at IIT Bombay, working in the area of Artificial Intelligence for Remote Sensing under the supervision of Dr. Biplab Banerjee. My research focuses on developing remote sensing foundation models, with an emphasis on self-supervised learning and multimodal representation learning for large-scale Earth observation data.

  My work lies at the intersection of deep learning, computer vision, and spectral remote sensing, where I investigate how foundation models and representation learning techniques can be leveraged to build scalable and generalizable systems for tasks such as multimodal understanding and cross-domain transfer. A key aspect of my research involves designing architectures and learning strategies that effectively capture spectral, spatial, and semantic information across heterogeneous data modalities.

  I am always open to discussions and potential research collaborations in related areas.
